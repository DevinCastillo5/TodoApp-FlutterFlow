<h1>To Do App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a to-do app that helps users track and manage their daily tasks. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed. The application is built using FlutterFlow, which generates the Flutter code for the app’s user interface, providing a clean and responsive experience across devices. All user data, including tasks, their details, and completion states, is securely stored and synchronized using Firebase. This to-do app provides a lightweight and intuitive tool for managing personal productivity, combining Flutter’s flexible UI with Firebase’s powerful backend services.

With this app, users can:
- Add new tasks to their personal task list
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete
- Edit task details if priorities change
- Delete tasks when they’re no longer needed
- Keep their task list synced across devices through Firebase backend
